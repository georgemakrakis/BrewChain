# BrewChain
NodeJS Blockchain implementation - Protecting the tea making ledger from unscrupulous colleagues  

This is a rough working example, contains a BrewNode, a BrewChain and an HTTP server
# Build and Run
Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder. Then run **node app.js**. Have to do this more than once. 

After that you can add some nodes to a chain using a browser by typing **http://localhost:port/addNode/node_number**.

Also you can create a block and dispatch it in the node with the following request **http://localhost:port/spawnBrew/block1â€™**
